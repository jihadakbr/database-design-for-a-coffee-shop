## Objective

My objective is to serve as a Data Engineer for a New York-based coffee shop chain aiming to expand nationally through franchise locations. I will be responsible for designing and implementing efficient relational database systems to streamline operations and enhance data infrastructure. By consolidating data from various sources, including accounting software, suppliers' databases, point of sales (POS) systems, and spreadsheets, I will create a centralized database. Additionally, I will create subsets of data required by business partners, export them, and load them into staging databases that use different Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). Ultimately, my goal is to empower executives to make data-driven decisions and contribute to the company's expansion and success.
